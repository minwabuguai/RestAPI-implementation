# RestAPI-implementation
This is a simple practice on implementing a RestAPI using spring.

I wrote some basic unit tests for the assignment. However, not all the details are tested. So you may still need to test with a Postman or something similar to check all the functions.

When you do  unit test, please test the single tests inside "ApiTest.java" one by one.
Testing the entire class in "ApiTest.java"  may cause failures, since all the operations are working on the same H2 database.
